This site uses api data from Openweather.org.
when a user inputs a city or zip code into the search bar, an api call is made with the user input.
from the response, the current weather is diplayed as well as a forcast and search history.
the search history is displayed as buttons that can be clicked to display the previously viewed city.
if the user searched at least once, if reloaded, the page will display the most previously viewed city.
a button allows you to change temp units.
